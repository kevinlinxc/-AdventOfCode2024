# Advent of Code 2024

Excited for this year's AOC =D

Cool things I learned:

Day 5: functools' cmp_to_key turns a comparison function into a key function
Day 10: Fun graph shit
Day 15: Cool video of robot moving boxes through a warehouse
Day 17: bit shifting, op codes, bit reconstruction lol
Day 21: Memoization, struggled for a long time before realizing I don't actually need memoization, just to track the frequencies of combinations
Day 24: Used networkx for visualization, ended up using graphviz for better visualization options.
